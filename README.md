# deep_learning_for_speech_enhancement_keras_python
deep learning based speech enhancement using keras python

# Authors: YONG XU & QIUQIANG KONG

sining will improve this code
Start BinCode

# Goal:
Make the GPU-C++ code project convert to python code which is much easier for the community to follow and use. The training and decoding code will be unified into the python code. Keras will be used as the toolkit.

# Invitation:
I want to invite you to be one of the contributors of this project, please contact me if you have interest. yong.xu.ustc@gmail.com

My final goal is to build a universal & robust deep learning based speech enhancement front end. And aslo try to adapt it to really serve for the speech recognition back-end.
